gmail filters
=============

These are a selection of the filters that I have running in gmail.

* ['billing-filters'] contains filters for various online purchase emails
* ['misc-filters'] contains miscellaneous filters that don't fit in anywhere else
* ['notifications-filters'] contains social media (and other) notifications that require very little attention
* ['newsletters-filters'] contains various subscription newsletter filters
* ['blackhole-filters'] contains various addresses that continually spam my account

These filters rely on the following gmail labels:

* Accounts
* Accounts/Github
* Billing & Banking
* Billing & Banking/Comms
* Billing & Banking/Amazon
* Billing & Banking/Groceries
* Deletable
* Deletable/Calendar
* Deletable/Facebook-LinkedIn
* Deletable/Newsletters
* Deletable/Newsletters/Deal-With
* Deletable/Other-Notifications
* Deletable/Other-Social
* Deletable/Sunrise
* Deletable/Twitter
* Deletable/Wordpress
* MailingList
* MailingList/DevOps
* MailingList/OpenTransport
* MailingList/Roosletter
* Misc
* Misc/HM Petitions
