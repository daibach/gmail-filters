gmail filters
=============

These are a selection of the filters that I have running in gmail.

* ['gmailfilters-billing'] contains filters for various online purchase emails
* ['gmailfilters-blackhole'] contains various addresses that continually spam my account
* ['gmailfilters-misc'] contains miscellaneous filters that don't fit in anywhere else
* ['gmailfilters-notifications'] contains social media (and other) notifications that require very little attention
* ['gmailfilters-newsletters'] contains various subscription newsletter filters

These filters rely on the following gmail labels:

* Accounts
* Accounts/Github
* Billing & Banking
* Billing & Banking/Comms
* Billing & Banking/Amazon
* Billing & Banking/Groceries
* Deletable
* Deletable/Calendar
* Deletable/Facebook-LinkedIn

* Deletable/Other-Notifications

* Deletable/Twitter
* Deletable/Wordpress
* MailingList
