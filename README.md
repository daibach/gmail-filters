gmail filters
=============

These are a selection of the filters that I have running in gmail.

* ['gmailfilters-notifications'] contains social media (and other) notifications that require very little attention
* ['gmailfilters-newsletters'] contains various subscription newsletter filters

These filters rely on the following gmail labels:

* Deletable
* Deletable/Calendar
* Deletable/Facebook-LinkedIn
* Deletable/Newsletters
* Deletable/Newsletters/Buying-Stuff
* Deletable/Newsletters/Deal-With
* Deletable/Other-Notifications
* Deletable/Other-Social
* Deletable/Sunrise
* Deletable/Twitter
* Deletable/Wordpress
* MailingList
* MailingList/DevOps
* MailingList/OpenTransport
